# Publicat

**Publicat** is a fast, scalable, and beautiful web app that transforms any structured `.csv` bibliography into an interactive journal explorer. Featuring timeline views, search capabilities, and D3.js visualizations, it's the perfect way to share archival metadata with the world—instantly.

This project builds on the structure of [vsesvit.vercel.app](https://vsesvit.vercel.app) and generalizes it for *any* CSV-based journal archive.

## 📂 How to Use with Your Own CSV

### 1. Format Your CSV

Your `.csv` file should have the following columns (headers must be exact):

```csv
journal_id,journal_name,journal_year,journal_number,article_name,author,translator,country,country_latin,language,language_latin
```

You can leave fields blank if not applicable.

### 2. Add Your File

Put your `.csv` inside the `/public/data/` folder.

Rename it something like `my_journal_data.csv`.

### 3. Update Code References

Search across the codebase and update:

```tsx
const CSV_URL = '/data/data_2.csv';
```

To:

```tsx
const CSV_URL = '/data/my_journal_data.csv';
```

This is found in:
- `index.tsx`
- `search.tsx`
- `visualizations.tsx`
- `ai_chat.tsx`

### 4. (Optional) Update Branding

Edit:
```tsx
<title>Vsesvit</title>
```
To:
```tsx
<title>Publicat</title>
```

Also update logos, meta descriptions, and `about.tsx` for your own flavor.
